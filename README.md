Building a Data Pipeline with Kafka, Spark Streaming and Cassandra

Apache Kafka is a scalable, high performance, low latency platform that allows reading and writing streams of data like a messaging system. We can start with Kafka in Java fairly easily.

Spark Streaming is part of the Apache Spark platform that enables scalable, high throughput, fault tolerant processing of data streams. Although written in Scala, Spark offers Java APIs to work with.

Apache Cassandra is a distributed and wide-column NoSQL data store. More details on Cassandra is available in our previous article.
